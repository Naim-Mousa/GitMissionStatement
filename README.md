# GitMissionStatement
This repository is aimed at simulating merge conflicts and how to resolve them.

After creating the initial repo, I create a new branch for it where I upload a file called missionstatement.txt with the mission statement of Facebook (I also upload this to the main branch).

Then, I iterate over the mission statement three times by changing it to make the vision more clear.

After doing that, I push the changed file to the main brach to create a merge conflict which I then resolve.
